# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. I determined the average danceability by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#2. I determined the top 10 artists and their tracks.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#3. I determined what artist released the longest track.
SELECT max(duration_ms), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#4. I determined which artist and their track had the lowest energy.
SELECT min(energy), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#5. I determined the average danceability for the 10 most popular song.
SELECT track_name,
avg(danceability),
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name, popularity 
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#6. I determined the least to most popular tracks by artist Doja Cat.
SELECT artist_name, 
track_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name LIKE 'Doja Cat'
ORDER BY popularity asc;

#7. I determined how many tracks were by artist Olivia Rodrigo.
SELECT count(track_name), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';

#8. I determined the average duration of tracks for 15 most popular artists.
SELECT avg(duration_ms), artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, popularity
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 15;
